## üìù Description

They not only enhance participants' creativity and AI awareness but also stimulate discussions on biases inherent in AI, as well as ethical considerations surrounding generative AI.

In concrete terms,  you will be asked in groups to write, create, and edit a short animated movie using a collection of AI tools. These tools include a chatbot for the creation of the script. Text-to-image models for creating the frames, image-to-video models for the animation of the frames and text-to-speech or music generation tools for the audio generation.

The format and theme of the generated content, as well as the technology involved, can be customized for each customer. 
Other technologies that can be covered: 

- 3D asset generation
- Gaussian splatting

## üìú Workshop Sequence
- A quick theory session about the technology that will be used during the workshop. The content can be adapted to the technical awareness of the audience. The goal is to give a general intuition about the technology used rather than giving an in-depth theory explanation.

- A practical session during which groups are formed and work on the given task.

- A final group discussion, where we showcase the results from each team, facilitating a dialogue addressing issues of bias, ethics, and copyright in AI-generated content.

## üíª Material
Ideally, each participant should have a laptop. 
One laptop per group of 3/4 people is also possible but less desirable.
