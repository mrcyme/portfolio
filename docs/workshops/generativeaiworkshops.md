## 📝 Description

The goal of this workshop is to offer an engaging platform for exploring the multifaceted world of AI and how its various technologies can impact the creative industry.  
Participants will be introduced to a range of AI tools, with a focus on understanding their key parameters and learning how to use them effectively.

In addition to hands-on exploration, the workshop will provide guidance on keeping up with the rapid evolution of AI technologies, helping participants distinguish truly valuable tools from passing trends or noise.

In concrete terms, participants will work in groups to write, create, and edit a short animated movie using a collection of AI tools. These include a chatbot for scriptwriting, text-to-image models for frame creation, image-to-video models to animate those frames, and text-to-speech or music generation tools for producing the audio track.

The format and theme of the generated content, as well as the tools used, can be customized for each client.  
Other technologies that can be covered include:

- 3D asset generation  
- 3D scanning  
- Gaussian splatting

## 📜 Workshop Sequence

- *(Optional)* A short theory session introducing the technologies used in the workshop. The content can be adapted to the audience’s level of technical familiarity. The aim is to provide a general intuition rather than an in-depth theoretical explanation.

- A hands-on session during which participants form groups and work on their animated movies.

- A closing group discussion where each team presents its result, opening a conversation around bias, ethics, and copyright in AI-generated content.

## 💻 Material

Ideally, each participant should have their own laptop.  
One laptop per group of 3–4 people is also possible, though less ideal.
